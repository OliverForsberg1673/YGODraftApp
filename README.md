The app will include a function for reading in the YGOPRODECK database API consisting of every Yu-gi-oh! card in existence.

With this database of cards the purpose will be to draft a deck of 40 cards that you can then save into a deck that you can give a name aswell as a rename at anytime, this deck will be then saved into a Mongo Atlas cloud database for safekeeping and future perusing if one so wishes.

You can also delete the decks at your own discretion, actually everyone can because this is a communism app where we all share each and every deck which means... sleep with one eye open i suppose. However if you actually want to play the card game with the generated deck you will have to copy the cards over to the card game or a official sim for the card which can be quite cumbersome and but hey atleast the decks are viewable.

now for usage of the web app its quite simple you go to the directed website hosted on "Render.com" where you will have to wait a sec or two for the cards to load, when they have loaded you will be presented with three card options a total of 40 times and the choice you make everytime will be result in your drafted deck.

When draft is complete it will ask you to input a name for the deck and then direct you to the second page "Manage decks" where you can Edit , Delete and show the whole decklist aswell.

Thats it for instructions now enjoy your incredibly robust and well thought out Yu-gi-oh! drafting app.
