The app will include a function for reading in the YGOPRODECK database API consisting of every yu-gi-oh! card in existence.
With this database of cards the purpose will be to draft a deck between 40-60 cards, 0-15 extra deck cards(you choose the parameters of the ratios before you start drafting)
A draft means that you construct your deck by choosing options presented to you, for example this app will present you three card options that you will pick 1 card from, this process you will repeat until you have picked 40-60 cards. 
The way you play a game with the results of the draft will not be provided within this app and to have a match you will have to replicate the outputted draft deck in a online simulator of the card game Yu-gi-oh! 
The purpose of such a app is to present the game in unique way that favours your knowledge of the game, a balanced deck with cards that can work with eachother will be key to win a match based on a draft.
